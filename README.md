# Theo

**Theo is your thoughtful personal assistant** — a private-by-default app that helps you stay organized, think clearly, and take the next right step.

Theo is built as a **Next.js app today**, with a clean path to evolve into a platform that connects to **integrations and micro-services** (calendar, email, tasks, notes, CRM, etc.) over time.

---

## What Theo does (today)

- A clean, fast UI for interacting with Theo
- A foundation for chat + structured “assistant actions”
- A place to centralize your preferences, projects, and context

## What Theo will become (roadmap)

- Connectors to services you already use (Google, Microsoft, Slack, etc.)
- “Skills” that handle specific workflows (planning, follow-ups, summaries)
- Micro-services for heavy/isolated concerns (sync, indexing, retrieval, automation)
- Strong privacy controls: **data minimization**, **least privilege**, **auditable actions**

---

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js** (App Router)
- **TypeScript**
- **React**
- Optional later: Postgres + Redis, background jobs, event bus, connectors
